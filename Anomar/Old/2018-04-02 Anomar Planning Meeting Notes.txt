2018-04-02 - Anomar - A Creative Community Gathering - Planning Meeting Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We had a great, productive session on Monday April 2, with twelve people in attendance. Our next meeting is Monday, May 14, 2018 (6pm at the Gallery). Please review what we have done below and provide any feedback (if I missed or misstated anything).

Here are the decisions we made:
- Our new target date is early June 2019.
- We will move to a monthly planning and coordination meeting. - Next one is Monday, May 14, 2018.
- Event name - "Anomar - A Creative Community Gathering". You must attend the meetings to hear what it means..... 
- Price - there should be a flat rate per person, extra for wine and a "whole family" price that makes it affordable. $20, $30, $50?? 
- We will have wine at the event, preferably available for people to enjoy throughout the site. 
- We need to define our "sustainability" goals and guidelines - what is good and achievable?

The agenda for the next meeting is (not necessarily in this order):
- Clean up the "Values" list below.
- Start organizing the "Delivery" items. This means working on making sure they are as complete as we can do to start, grouping and defining the work that needs to start on them and finding leaders and resources for them.

Here is the visioning work we have completed:
1) Values - What are the values that should drive our plans? (We need to clean this list up)
 > Affordable
 > Everyone feels welcome
 > Families - all generations
 > Ramona!
 > As Sustainable as we can be
 > Creativity - in all its forms
 > "Only 300 Cars!"
 > Not a craft Faire
 > Intimacy
 > Integrity

2) Drivers - Why do a Ramona Creative Festival? 
 - People Need Encouragement - People need opportunities and the encouragement to be creative and see how it can enrich their lives (and there are not enough of this happening).
 - Creativity In Everything - There are more varieties of creativity than most people normally think about.
 - Ramona! - Ramona has a lot of creative people that could be promoted and new collaborative efforts could be started. 
 - Creativity Changes People - Creative pursuits benefit not only individuals but our community as it can break down barriers and bring people together. 

3) Goals - What should the festival accomplish (our goals to answer the "Why")?
 + Inspired and Entertained - Attendees are inspired and entertained seeing artists in action.
 + Hands-on - People tried new “art” and engaged in something hands-on and interactive.
 + Collaborative - People had collaborative creative experiences and new collective ventures were started.
 + Personal - People have a new appreciation for creativity, see how it benefits them, their families and the community and want to have it as a part of their lives in the future.
 + Immersive - People were immersed in a creative experience, did not want it to end, and want to do this event again.

4) Delivery - What do we need to deliver (in preparation, organization, management and end-product) to meet our goals?
